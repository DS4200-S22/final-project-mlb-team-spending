    <h1>Abstract</h1>
        
    <p>
      The MLB is one of the most popular sports leagues in the US and we are creating a visualization displaying how much money 
      different teams spend on players each year vs. how well they perform. Our visualization will allow the end user to make their 
      own decisions on whether a franchise spent a reasonable sum of money on their total player salaries based on their win percentage. 
      This project is important because it provides background and further analysis on team spending that will help team leadership make 
      important decisions, optimizing budget for performance.

  <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>
  
  <p>
    Our final visualization has several components. The first graph shows individual team percent wins over the 1988 to 2018 sesons. 
    The percent wins are calculated by finding the ratio of wins/games and converting it into a percentage. The second graph is 
    individual team spending on salary on Opening Day (OD salary) over the 1988 to 2018 seasons. The color of the line on the first and second 
    line graph is in the team color. The team being analyzed can change using the drop down menu at the top left corner of the visualization. 
    An average salary line can be toggled on and off (with the "Toggle Average Salary" button) on the team spending on salary line chart to give 
    a point of reference as to whether a team is spending more or less than other teams.  The average salary is calculated by totaling the teams' 
    Opening Day salary for that year and divided by the number of teams.  When points on the team percent wins graph are brushed over, the corresponding 
    points are highlighted on the team spending on salary graph and vice versa.  When you brush over the points on the first graph, a tooltip will appear on 
    both graphs, displaying the brushed and highlighted values' year along with the Percent Win value and OD Salary value, respectively. 
    The varying colors for each team will allow users to further identify which team they are analyzing.  The brushing and linking, along 
    with the tooltip, connects the Percent Win Value with the OD Salary side by side, allowing users to easily 
    compare the trends between salary and wins over the years. These two graphs help in answering the question: does spending more money on 
    team salary correlate to better team performance? 
    <br>
    <br>
    In addition to the two line graphs, there is a postseason bracket which shows the progression of teams towards the World Series Championship. 
    The teams that enter into the postseason either won their division (American League West, Central, and East and National League West, Central, and East) 
    or were the top two teams in their league that finished second in their division, also known as the wildcard spot.  The left side of the bracket shows the American League 
    and the right side shows the National League. The color within the circles on the bracket show how much the team spent on team salary by Opening Day. The darker the color, 
    the more the team spent.  The color gradient scale shows the specific amount in relation to the color. The yellow ring around the circle signifies who won the World Series that year. 
    When hovering over the circles on the bracket, the team name and OD Salary will appear on the tooltip. The postseason bracket can be viewed for the 2012 to 2018 season, which can be 
    changed using the drop down menu at the top left corner of the visualization.  Every team's goal is to win the World Series, so this bracket would show to teams' executive management 
    whether spending more money results in a World Series win.
