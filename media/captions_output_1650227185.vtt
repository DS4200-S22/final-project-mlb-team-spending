00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Our project is analyzing the correlation between

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.929 align:middle line:84%
baseball team spending on salary

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:06.841 align:middle line:84%
and team success.

00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:09.138 align:middle line:84%
Our three visualizations show

00:00:09.138 --> 00:00:11.629 align:middle line:84%
an individual team's percent wins

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.166 align:middle line:84%
over the 1988 to 2018 seasons,

00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.660 align:middle line:84%
an individual team's spending on salary

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.518 align:middle line:84%
over the 1988 to 2018 seasons,

00:00:20.518 --> 00:00:21.834 align:middle line:84%

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:25.163 align:middle line:84%
and the postseason bracket for each season.

00:00:25.163 --> 00:00:27.823 align:middle line:84%
Showing team spending on salary

00:00:27.823 --> 00:00:30.654 align:middle line:84%
on a color gradient scale.

00:00:30.654 --> 00:00:32.725 align:middle line:84%

00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:36.033 align:middle line:84%
The first two visualizations are meant to answer the question:

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:39.009 align:middle line:84%
"Does spending more money on team salary correlate to

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:40.616 align:middle line:84%
better team performance?"

00:00:40.616 --> 00:00:41.259 align:middle line:84%

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:44.895 align:middle line:84%
The dropdown menu allows you to select the team you would like to look at.

00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:45.902 align:middle line:84%

00:00:45.902 --> 00:00:47.744 align:middle line:84%
You can brush on one graph,

00:00:47.744 --> 00:00:50.982 align:middle line:84%
and it will highlight the corresponding points on the other graph.

00:00:50.982 --> 00:00:53.631 align:middle line:84%
Brushing over the points will also initialize

00:00:53.631 --> 00:00:56.540 align:middle line:84%
a tooltip to appear on both graphs,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.497 align:middle line:84%
displaying the brushed values.

00:00:58.497 --> 00:01:02.203 align:middle line:84%
Both graphs have brushing and linking capabilities.

00:01:02.203 --> 00:01:06.368 align:middle line:84%
To gain a better understanding of where team spending lies

00:01:06.368 --> 00:01:08.602 align:middle line:84%
in relation to other teams' spending,

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:12.679 align:middle line:84%
an average salary line can be toggled on and off.

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:14.886 align:middle line:84%

00:01:14.886 --> 00:01:18.911 align:middle line:84%
The third visualization is a bracket that represents

00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:22.327 align:middle line:84%
the elimination tournament held after the conclusion

00:01:22.327 --> 00:01:25.069 align:middle line:84%
of the Major League Baseball regular season,

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:27.267 align:middle line:84%
also known as the Postseason.

00:01:27.267 --> 00:01:31.961 align:middle line:84%
The World Series is the championship tournament at the end of the Postseason.

00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:34.167 align:middle line:84%
The winner of the World Series is indicated

00:01:34.167 --> 00:01:37.019 align:middle line:84%
by the yellow border surrounding the team.

00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:40.429 align:middle line:84%
The colors inside the circles on the bracket represent

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.893 align:middle line:84%
how much the team has spent that year.

00:01:42.893 --> 00:01:44.773 align:middle line:84%
The scale at the bottom shows

00:01:44.773 --> 00:01:48.330 align:middle line:84%
the color gradient in relation to the scale of team spending.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.136 align:middle line:84%
The dropdown menu allows you to select

00:01:51.136 --> 00:01:55.215 align:middle line:84%
the Postseason year from 2012 to 2018.

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:58.016 align:middle line:84%
The tooltip shows the team name,

00:01:58.016 --> 00:02:03.015 align:middle line:84%
and their exact spending for that year.
